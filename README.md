# geoyi_dockers

I recently built several docker images and hosted on my Dockerhub. 

- `docker pull geoyi/sez_nl_py3` is a docker image that built on top of `developmentseed/geolambda` that can run geospatial raster processing;

- `geoyi/pixel_decoder_notebook` is a nvidia-docker image that can run deep learning on GPU with tensorflow, opencv, and jupyternotebook
